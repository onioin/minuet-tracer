# Requirements
c++17 compatible compiler for running c++ version
```
pip3 install open3d
```

This repository contains a Python script that uses the Open3D library to visualize point cloud data. The script loads a point cloud from a file, applies voxel downsampling, and visualizes the original and downsampled point clouds side by side.
There are three main scripts in this repository:
- minuet_mapping.py and c++ version minuet_trace_cpp (6x faster than python version) 
- map_trace_reader.py (for reading the memory trace file generated by the minuet_mapping.py and c++ version)
- read_pcl.py (for reading the point cloud data and visualizing it using Open3D. Can hookup trace reader using pybind)


# Point cloud mapping tracer


```bash
# Python version
python3 minuet_trace.py 
# c++ version. 
cd c++; cmake -B build; cd build; make
./minuet_mapping
```

This project simulates the memory access patterns of a Minuet-like kernel map algorithm. It includes both a c++ version and a python version. The simulation employs a fixed pool of virtual threads to model parallel processing. The primary output is a compressed binary file (`map_trace.bin.gz` python version or `map_trace_cpp.bin.gz` c++ version) containing the recorded memory accesses, which can be used for analyzing memory behavior, locality, and potential bottlenecks.

Input Format
The input to the simulation is a set of 3D coordinates representing points in space. These coordinates are quantized and packed into 12-bit integer keys. The input data is generated within the simulation itself, so no external input files are required.



### Output Trace Format.

| Section | Field | Data Type | Description |
|---------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Header | Entry Count | `uint32_t` | Total number of trace entries that follow |
| Trace Entry | `phase_id` | `uint8_t` | Integer ID representing the computational phase during which the access occurred. Dynamically assigned during the `write_gmem_trace` function, and the mapping is printed to the console |
| | `thread_id` | `uint8_t` | The ID of the virtual thread that performed the memory access |
| | `op_id` | `uint8_t` | Integer ID for the memory operation type (0 for Read 'R', 1 for Write 'W') |
| | `tensor_id` | `uint8_t` | Integer ID representing the tensor region being accessed |
| | `addr_int` | `uint32_t` | The memory address that was accessed. Note that addresses are truncated to 32 bits in the output file  |

`NOTE THAT THIS IS JUST THE MAPPING PHASE SO 32 BIT ADDRESS SPACE IS ENOUGH FOR THE MEMORY TRACE FILE.`
`IF WE ARE FETCHING ACTUAL FEATURE VECTORS, THE ADDRESS SPACE WILL NEED TO BE 64 BIT.`

### Input format


- coords: A Python list of tuples, where each tuple (x, y, z) represents the integer coordinates of a point.
Example: coords = [(1,5,0),(0,1,1),(0,0,2),(0,0,3)]
- offsets: A Python list of 3D offset tuples (dx, dy, dz). These offsets are applied to the input coordinates to generate query points.
Example: offsets = [(dx,dy,dz) for dx in (-1,0,1) for dy in (-1,0,1) for dz in (-1,0,1)]

## Core Simulation Phases

Simulates the following key phases:

1.  **Radix Sort Simulation (`Radix-Sort` & `Dedup`):**
    * Input 3D coordinates are quantized and packed into 32-bit integer keys.
    * Memory access patterns for a radix sort are simulated on these keys (reads from an input array, writes to an auxiliary array, then swap).
    * The keys are then explicitly sorted using `std::sort` and deduplicated to obtain unique input keys.
2.  **Build Queries (`Build-Queries`):**
    * Query keys are generated by applying a set of 3D offsets to each unique input key.
    * Associated metadata arrays are created: `qii` (query input-index), `qki` (query kernel/offset-index), and `woffs` (packed weight-offset keys).
3.  **Sort Query Keys (`Sort-QKeys`):**
    * This phase, mirroring the Python script's logic, currently involves assigning the previously generated query keys. No actual sorting operation is performed within this named phase in the C++ version, matching the Python script's behavior.
4.  **Tile and Pivot Generation (`Tile-Pivots`):**
    * The unique sorted input keys are partitioned into smaller collections called "tiles."
    * The first key of each tile is stored as a "pivot." Memory write accesses for these pivot keys are recorded.
5.  **Lookup (`Lookup`):**
    * This is the main multi-threaded phase where query keys are matched against the tiled input data.
    * The workload (queries) is divided among `NUM_THREADS` worker threads.
    * Each thread processes its assigned queries:
        * It performs a backward search on the global pivot keys to efficiently identify a relevant tile for the current query key.
        * It then performs a forward scan within that specific tile to find an exact match for the query key.
        * If a match is found, an entry detailing the match (target coordinates, original input coordinates, offset coordinates) is added to a shared `KernelMap` data structure.
    * Memory accesses (reads for query keys, pivot keys, tile data; writes for kernel map entries) are recorded by each thread into a thread-local trace buffer. These local traces are then merged into the global memory trace vector, protected by a mutex. The `KernelMap` is also protected by a separate mutex.



## Building the c++ Project

### Prerequisites

* A C++17 compliant compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC).
* CMake (version 3.10 or higher).
* Zlib development libraries (for gzip compression).
    * On Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev`
    * On macOS (using Homebrew): `brew install zlib`


### Build Steps

1.  **Clone or download the project source code.**
2.  **Create a build directory and navigate into it:**
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```
3.  **Run CMake to configure the project:**
    ```bash
    cmake ..
    ```
    If Zlib is installed in a non-standard location, you might need to help CMake find it (e.g., `cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/zlib_install_dir`).
4.  **Compile the project:**
    ```bash
    make
    ```
## Running the Simulation

After a successful build, an executable named `minuet_trace_cpp` 


To run the simulation:

```bash
./minuet_trace_cpp
```

The program will:
Print information about each phase to the console.
If debug is enabled (default is true), print detailed outputs like sorted unique keys, segmented query arrays, and the final kernel map.
Print all recorded memory trace entries to the console.
Generate the map_trace_cpp.bin.gz file in the current working directory (which will be the build directory if run from there).

## Trace Reader

This script reads the memory trace file generated by the Minuet-like kernel map simulation. It provides functionality to filter the trace by computational phase or memory operation type (read/write) and visualize the memory access patterns using Open3D.


```bash
# How to run
$ python map_trace_reader.py map_trace.bin.gz

# # Filter trace by phase
$ python map_trace_reader.py map_trace.bin.gz --filter-phase "Lookup"

# # Filter trace by operation
$ python map_trace_reader.py map_trace.bin.gz --filter-op "W"

# # Generate memory access pattern plots
$ python map_trace_reader.py map_trace.bin.gz --plot

# # Save plot to file
$ python map_trace_reader.py map_trace.bin.gz --plot --plot-file memory_access.png
```
